# 61C Spring 2022 Project 1: Snake

Spec: [https://cs61c.org/sp22/projects/proj1/](https://cs61c.org/sp22/projects/proj1/)

Language: C

Project description:
This is a program for a simple snake game. You move using the WASD keys. Consuming fruits (denoted as asterisks) makes your snake grow by one unit.

Set up the executable by entering "make interactive-snake" from within the folder into the terminal. Then, enter "./interactive-snake" to begin a game. 

You can make the game faster or slower by entering "./interactive-snake -d #" instead, where # is the number of seconds between each time step. 1 second is the default

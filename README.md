# 61C Spring 2022 Project 1: Snake

Spec: [https://cs61c.org/sp22/projects/proj1/](https://cs61c.org/sp22/projects/proj1/)

TODO: describe what you did
load_state was the worst
it took like 70% of the time to do this
fixing memory bugs took forever (ex: not reallocing the right size, using a number and not multiplying by sizeof(type)) it was espectially gruelling because the memory gets corrupted and you won't know until later in the program, making it so easy to get distracted by red herrings
suffered a lot for this project, esp. since im new to C
good project though
interesting and fun (aside from debugging)
ngl load_state was the most miserable because of it being so hard to debug
everything else was fairly ok
i liked doing the part where you update the head and tail the most (so easy to do the helper functions).
